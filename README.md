## Description
This machine learning model was created to predict the user's sign language by detecting and also classifying the user's hand movements. This model aims to bridge the communication gap by developing a machine learning-powered system to translate sign language gestures captured in video into text. The project centers on the integration of the SIBI (Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia), which specifically caters to Indonesian Sign Language. Its main feature is as a translator of sign language gestures from a video stream in real-time.This model was built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Datasets
The dataset is gathered from kaggle and gathered by our team. These are the following links:

* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utsavk02/wlasl-complete

The dataset from Kaggle that has successfully gone through the data collection and data cleaning process is then compiled to produce the 10 most frequently used Indonesian words. From the vast amount of data in the Kaggle database, we only take 10 words that have videos with a high level of precision per video. Here is the link to the clean Google Drive dataset:
