## Description
This machine learning model was created to predict the user's sign language by detecting and also classifying the user's hand movements. This model was built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Datasets
The dataset is gathered from kaggle and gathered by our team. These are the following links:

The dataset from Kaggle that has successfully gone through the data collection and data cleaning process is then compiled to produce the 10 most frequently used Indonesian words. From the vast amount of data in the Kaggle database, we only take 10 words that have videos with a high level of precision per video. Here is the link to the clean Google Drive dataset:
